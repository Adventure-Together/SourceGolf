# Source Golf!

SOURCE GOLF!!!!

Source Golf is a golf simulation dice roller party game where players can build custom courses and play golf.  
Players will take turns choosing a club and hitting a golf ball towards the hole. 
Source Golf is a scaleable game. In terms of player counts, rounds played, and the size of the course, its all up to you. 

The SOURCE systemâ€™s hexes and tiles were purpose-built to allow for in-game terrain modularity, with the unique biome artwork directly impacting gameplay.
